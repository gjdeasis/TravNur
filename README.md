# TravNur
TravNur was a project created for COMP 541: Data Mining. For the purpose of this project, TravNur is an agency that assigns traveling nurses to the hospital. The goal of this project is to anticipate the hospital's need for additional staffing with a 70% accuracy 1 week before the shortage occurs.
